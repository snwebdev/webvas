Trying to figure out how to create a sort of web version of VASSAL, i.e. something that runs in the browser and allows enables you to play boardgames, primarily hex and counter wargames.

First task was to try to figure out how to move something with a mouse. For some reason that I can't remember , I thought it a good idea to have each counter in a div, and to move that div.

This implimentation has a large map div and a smaller counter div, on top of it. Clicking on the counter can be dragged and released.

This is all mouse stuff, no touch.

This is all based on (i.e. taken from) a blog post (Create a Draggable Element in JavaScript
by kirupa, 26 April 2018) copied in the resource file. The author seems to think that the translate3d transform is a good way to move things about. Will stick with it for now.

Not sure while the counter div has a blinking curser in it.

Next task is to see if I can get the dropped counter to snap to a position.
